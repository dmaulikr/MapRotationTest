MapRotationTest
---------------

When you do a game where a player can walk through a world, you usually
rotate the world around around the player. This little example app does
just that. It takes four coordinates in the world and rotates and translates
them so the player's position is centered in the view.

Use the up and down arrow keys to move forward/backward.
Use the left and right arrow keys to turn.
Hold shift while pressing left and right arrow keys to side-step.

This technique can be used to place elements in a 3D game correctly on screen.
